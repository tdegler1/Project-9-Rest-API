# Project-9-Rest-API
This is a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.  In addition, the API will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.
